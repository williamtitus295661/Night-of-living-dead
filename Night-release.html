    <p>Night of the Living Dead trailer highlighting the film's gore and violence
       Night of the Living Dead premiered on October 1, 1968, at the Fulton Theater in Pittsburgh. 
       Nationally, it was a Saturday afternoon matinée—typical for horror films at the time—and 
       attracted the usual horror film audience of mainly pre-teens and adolescents. The MPAA film 
       rating system was not in place until the following month, so children were able to purchase 
       tickets. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times chided theater owners and parents who allowed 
       children access to a film they were entirely unprepared for. Ebert noted that the children 
       in the audience initially displayed typical reactions to '60s horror films, including shouting 
       when ghouls appeared on the screen. He said that the atmosphere in the theater shifted to grim 
       silence as the protagonists each began to fail, die, and be consumed—either by fire or the 
       undead. The deaths of Ben, Barbra, and the supporting cast showed audiences an uncomfortable, 
       nihilistic outlook that was unusual for the genre. According to Ebert:</p>

    <p>The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped 
       being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There 
       was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in 
       her seat and crying ... It's hard to remember what sort of effect this movie might have had on 
       you when you were six or seven. But try to remember. At that age, kids take the events on the 
       screen seriously, and they identify fiercely with the hero. When the hero is killed, that's not 
       an unhappy ending but a tragic one: Nobody got out alive. It's just over, that's all.</p>

    <p>A review in Variety denounced the movie as a moral failing of the film's makers, the horror 
       genre, and regional cinema. The reviewer claimed that the "unrelieved orgy of sadism" was 
       effectively pornography due to its extreme violence.[100] These early denouncements would not 
       limit the film's commercial success or later critical recognition.</p>

                    <p>Critical reception</p>
    <p>The neon marquee of a theater lists several notable cult films including Donnie Darko, Reanimator, 
       and Night of the Living Dead.</p>
    <p>Decades after its initial release, a theater runs a midnight showing of the cult classic
       Despite the controversy, five years after the premiere Paul McCullough of Take One observed that 
       Night of the Living Dead was the "most profitable horror film ever ... produced outside the walls 
       of a major studio". In the decade after its release, the film grossed over $15 million at the U.S. 
       box office. It was translated into over 25 languages. The Wall Street Journal reported that it was 
       the top-grossing film in Europe in 1968. In a 1971 Newsweek article, Paul D. Zimmerman noted that 
       the film had "become a bona fide cult movie for a burgeoning band of blood-lusting cinema buffs".</p>

    <p>Decades after its release, the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives positive 
       reviews. In 2008, the film was ranked by Empire magazine No. 397 of The 500 Greatest Movies of 
       All Time. The New York Times also placed the film on their Best 1000 Movies Ever list. In January 
       2010, Total Film included the film on its list of The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. Rolling Stone 
       named Night of the Living Dead one of The 100 Maverick Movies in the Last 100 Years. Reader's Digest 
       found it to be the 12th scariest movie of all time. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 
       95% of 84 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.9/10. The website's consensus 
       reads: "George A. Romero's debut set the template for the zombie film, and features tight editing, 
       realistic gore, and a sly political undercurrent." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, 
       assigned the film a score of 89 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".</p>

    <p>Night of the Living Dead was awarded two distinguished honors decades after its debut. The Library 
       of Congress added the film to the National Film Registry in 1999 with other films deemed "culturally, 
       historically or aesthetically significant". In 2001, the film was ranked No. 93 by the American Film 
       Institute on their AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills list, a list of America's most heart-pounding movies. 
       The zombies in the picture were also a candidate for AFI's AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Heroes & Villains, 
       in the villains category, but failed to make the official list.[118] The Chicago Film Critics Association 
       named it the 5th scariest film ever made. The film also ranked No. 9 on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.</p>

    <p>New Yorker critic Pauline Kael called the film "one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies ever made – 
       and when you leave the theatre you may wish you could forget the whole horrible experience. ... The film's 
       grainy, banal seriousness works for it – gives it a crude realism". A Film Daily critic commented, "This 
       is a pearl of a horror picture that exhibits all the earmarks of a sleeper." While Roger Ebert criticized 
       the matinée screening, he admitted that he "admires the movie itself". Critic Rex Reed wrote, "If you want 
       to see what turns a B movie into a classic ... don't miss Night of the Living Dead. It is unthinkable for 
       anyone seriously interested in horror movies not to see it."</p>

                 <p>Copyright status and home media</p>
    <p>In the United States, Night of the Living Dead was mistakenly released into the public domain because the 
       original distributor failed to replace the copyright notice when changing the film's name. Image Ten displayed 
       a notice on the title frames of the film beneath the original title, Night of the Flesh Eaters, but the Walter 
       Reade Organization removed it when changing the title. At that time, United States copyright law held that 
       public dissemination required copyright notice to maintain a copyright. Several years after the film's release, 
       its creators discovered that the original prints distributed to theaters had no copyright protection.</p>

    <p>Because Night of the Living Dead was not copyrighted, it has received hundreds of home video releases on VHS, 
       Betamax, DVD, Blu-ray, and other formats. Over two hundred distinct versions of the film have been released 
       on tapes alone.[128] Numerous versions of the film have appeared on DVD, Blu-ray, and LaserDisc with varying quality. 
       The original film is available to view or download for free on many websites. As of February 2024, it is the 
       Internet Archive's third most-viewed film, with over 3.5 million views.</p>

    <p>The film received a VHS release in 1993 through Tempe Video. The next year, a THX certified 25th anniversary Laserdisc 
       was released by Elite Entertainment. It features special features, including commentary, trailers, gallery files, and more. 
       In 1999, Russo's revised version of the film, Night of the Living Dead: 30th Anniversary Edition, was released on VHS and 
       DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment. In 2002, Elite Entertainment released a special edition DVD featuring the original cut. 
       Dimension Extreme released a restored print of the film on DVD. This was followed by a 4K restoration Blu-ray released 
       by The Criterion Collection on February 13, 2018, sourced from a print owned by the Museum of Modern Art and acquired by 
       Janus Films. This release also features a workprint edit of the film under the title of Night of Anubis, in addition to 
       various bonus materials. In February 2020, Netflix took down Night of the Living Dead from its streaming service in Germany 
       following a legal request in 2017 because "a version of the film is banned in that country."</p>

                            <p>Revisions</p>
    <p>There are numerous revised versions of the film with content added, deleted, rearranged, or more heavily modified. From its 
       initial release into the public domain, Night of the Living Dead was widely screened from inferior prints in grindhouse theaters, 
       a trend that continued among the bottom-tier home video companies. The first major revisions of Night of the Living Dead involved 
       colorization by home video distributors. Hal Roach Studios released a colorized version in 1986 that featured ghouls with pale 
       green skin.[146][147] Another colorized version appeared in 1997 from Anchor Bay Entertainment with grey-skinned zombies. In 2009, 
       Legend Films co-produced a colorized 3D version of the film with PassmoreLab, a company that converts 2-D film into 3-D format. 
       The film was theatrically released on October 14, 2010. According to Legend Films founder Barry Sandrew, Night of the Living 
       Dead is the first entirely live action 2-D film to be converted to 3-D.</p>

    <p>In 1999, co-writer Russo released a modified version called Night of the Living Dead: 30th Anniversary Edition. He filmed additional 
       scenes and recorded a revised soundtrack composed by Scott Vladimir Licina. In an interview with Fangoria magazine, Russo explained 
       that he wanted to "give the movie a more modern pace". Russo took liberties with the original script. The additions are neither 
       clearly identified nor even listed. Entertainment Weekly reported "no bad blood" between Russo and Romero. The magazine quoted Romero 
       as saying, "I didn't want to touch Night of the Living Dead". Critics disliked the revised film, notably Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool 
       News, who promised to permanently ban anyone from his publication who offered positive criticism of the film.</p>

    <p>A collaborative animated project known as Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated was screened at several film festivals and was released 
       onto DVD on July 27, 2010, by Wild Eye Releasing. This project aims to "reanimate" the 1968 film by replacing Romero's celluloid images 
       with animation done in a wide variety of styles by artists from around the world, laid over the original audio from Romero's version. 
       Night of the Living Dead: Reanimated was nominated in the category of Best Independent Production (film, documentary or short) for 
       the 8th Annual Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards.</p>

    <p>Starting in 2015, and working from the original camera negatives and audio track elements, a 4K digital restoration of Night of the 
       Living Dead was undertaken by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and The Film Foundation.[162] The fully restored version was shown in 
       November 2016 as part of To Save and Project: The 14th MoMA International Festival of Film Preservation. This same restoration was 
       released on Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection on February 13, 2018, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 4, 2022.</p>
