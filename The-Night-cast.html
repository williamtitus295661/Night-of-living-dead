                         <p>Cast</p>
            <p>Ben holds a rifle in the farmhouse living room.
               Ben, played by Duane Jones
               The low-budget film included no well-known actors, but propelled the careers of 
               some cast members. Two independent film companies from Pittsburgh—Hardman 
               Associates and director George A. Romero's The Latent Image—combined to form Image 
               Ten, a production company chartered only to create Night of the Living Dead. The
               cast consisted of members of Image Ten, actors previously cast for their commercials,
               acquaintances of Romero, and Pittsburgh stage actors.</p>

               <p>Duane Jones as Ben. The casting was potentially controversial in 1968 when it was rare for a 
                black man to be cast as the hero of an American film primarily composed of white actors, but 
                Romero said that Jones performed the best in his audition. Jones went on to appear in other 
                films, including Ganja & Hess (1973) and Beat Street (1984), but worried that people only 
                recognized him as Ben.</p>
            <p>Judith O'Dea as Barbra. A 23-year-old commercial and stage actress, O'Dea previously worked for 
                Hardman and Eastman in Pittsburgh. O'Dea was in Hollywood seeking entry to the movie business when
                contacted about the role. O'Dea expressed surprise at the film's cultural impact and the renown
                it brought her.</p>
                <p>Karl Hardman as Harry Cooper. President of Hardman Associates, Karl Hardman, played the hostile
                father. Cooper's wife was played by Hardman's real-life business and romantic partner Marilyn Eastman.
                </p>
            <p>Marilyn Eastman as Helen Cooper. Vice president of Hardman Associates, Marilyn Eastman played the
             doomed mother Helen Cooper and the unnamed, bug-eating zombie. She later appeared in Santa Claws (1996), 
             directed by John Russo.
            <p>Kyra Schon as Karen Cooper. Hardman's daughter in real life, 9-year-old Schon also portrayed the
             mangled corpse on the house's upstairs floor that Ben drags away.</p>
            <p>Keith Wayne as Tom. "Keith Wayne" was Ronald Keith Hartman's stage name. After this lone acting 
            role, Wayne went on to work as a singer, dancer, musician, and night-club owner. Wayne became a
            successful chiropractor in North Carolina. Wayne explained the change in careers during a 1992 interview,
            "I am not that person anymore. I got to a point in my life where I wanted to have some control. I 
             didn't want to wake up at 40 or 50 and not be in control." In 1995, he took his own life at age 50.</p>
            <p>Judith Ridley as Judy. The 19-year-old receptionist from Hardman Associates auditioned for Barbra without any
             acting experience and was given the less-demanding role of Judy. Ridley starred in Romero's unsuccessful second
             feature There's Always Vanilla (1971).</p>
            <p>Bill Hinzman, who played the first ghoul encountered by Barbra and Johnny in the cemetery, went on to work on a
             number of horror films including The Majorettes (1986) and Flesheater (1988).</p>
            <p>George Kosana as Sheriff McClelland. Kosana also served as the film's production manager.</p>
            <p>George Kosana as Sheriff McClelland. Kosana also served as the film's production manager.</p>
            <p>Bill "Chilly Billy" Cardille as himself. Cardille was well known in Pittsburgh as a TV presenter who hosted
             a horror film anthology series, Chiller Theatre. His daughter Lori would go on to star in Romero's
             Day of the Dead (1985).</p>
