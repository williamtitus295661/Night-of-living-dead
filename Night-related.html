Night of the Living Dead is the first of six ... of the Dead films directed 
by George Romero. Following the 1968 film, Romero released Dawn of the Dead, 
Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead, Diary of the Dead and Survival of the Dead. 
Each film traces the evolution of the living dead epidemic in the United States and 
humanity's desperate attempts to cope with it. As in Night of the Living Dead, Romero 
peppered the other films in the series with critiques specific to the periods in which 
they were released. Romero died with several "Dead" projects unfinished, including the 
posthumously completed novel The Living Dead and the upcoming film The Twilight of the Dead.</p>

     <p>Return of the Living Dead series
Main article: Return of the Living Dead (film series)
The Return of the Living Dead series takes place in an alternate continuity where both the 
original film and the titular living dead exist. The series has a complicated relationship 
with Romero's Dead films. Co-writer John Russo wrote the novel Return of the Living Dead 
(1978) as a sequel to the original film and collaborated with Night alumni Russ Streiner 
and Rudy Ricci on a screenplay under the same title. In 1981, investment banker Tom Fox 
bought the rights to the story. Fox brought in Dan O'Bannon to direct and rewrite the script, 
changing nearly everything but the title. O'Bannon's The Return of the Living Dead arrived in 
theaters in 1985 alongside Day of the Dead. Romero and his associates attempted to block Fox 
from marketing his film as a sequel and demanded the name be changed. In a previous court case, 
Dawn Associates v. Links (1978), they had prevented Illinois-based film distributor William Links 
from re-releasing an unrelated film under the title Return of the Living Dead. Fox was forced to 
cease his advertising campaign but allowed to retain the title.</p>

    <p>Rise of the Living Dead
George Cameron Romero, the son of director George A. Romero, wrote a prequel to his father's classic, 
under the working titles Origins and Rise of the Living Dead. George Cameron Romero said that he 
created Rise of the Living Dead as an homage to his father's work, a glimpse into the political turmoil 
of the mid-to-late 1960s, and a bookend piece to his father's original story. Despite raising funds for 
the film on Indiegogo in 2014, as of 2023 the film has yet to go into production. In April 2021, Heavy 
Metal magazine published the first issue of a graphic novel adaptation of the story titled The Rise 
from Romero's script and with art by Diego Yapur.</p>

    <p>Remakes and other related films
Main article: Night of the Living Dead remakes
Many remakes have attempted to reimagine the original film's story, most notably the 1990 remake written 
by Romero and directed by special effects artist Tom Savini. Savini had planned to work on the 1968 film 
before being drafted into the Vietnam War, and, after the war, worked with Romero on the sequels. The 
remake was based on the original screenplay but included a revised plot that portrayed Barbra 
(Patricia Tallman) as a capable and active heroine. Film historian Barry Grant interprets the new Barbara 
as a reversal of the original film's portrayal of feminine passivity. He explores how the 1990 Barbra 
embodies—arguably masculine—virtuous professionalism, as depicted in the works of classic Hollywood 
director Howard Hawks, a major influence on Romero. Grant describes her as the film's only Hawksian 
professional. After changing from a mousy outfit that mirrors the original into the visually militaristic 
clothing she discovers in the farmhouse, Barbra is the lone character able to separate her emotions from 
the objective necessity to exterminate the living dead. According to Grant, Romero is able to offer one 
of the most important feminist outlooks in horror because the undead disrupt all traditional values including 
patriarchy.</p>

<p>Due to its public domain status, many independent producers have created remakes of Night of the Living Dead. 
   The film has been remade more than any other movie. Independent remakes have used the film's titular 
   "living dead" as an allegory for racial tension, terrorism, nuclear war, and beyond.</p>

     <p>In other media</p>
<p>At the suggestion of Bill Hinzman (the actor who played the zombie that first attacks Barbra in the graveyard 
   and kills her brother Johnny at the beginning of the original film), composers Todd Goodman and Stephen 
   Catanzarite composed an opera Night of the Living Dead based on the film. The Microscopic Opera Company produced 
   its world premiere, which was performed at the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater in Pittsburgh, in October 2013. The opera 
   was awarded the American Prize for Theater Composition in 2014.</p>

<p>A play called Night of the Living Dead Live! was published in 2017 and has been performed in major cities including 
   Toronto, Leeds and Auckland.</p>
