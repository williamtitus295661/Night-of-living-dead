<p>The creation of a high-budget television commercial for Calgon brand detergent
     spurred the film's producers to create a horror movie.</p>
     <p>George Romero embarked upon his career in the film industry while attending 
        Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He directed and produced television 
        commercials and industrial films for The Latent Image, a company he co-founded 
        with his friend Russell Streiner. The Latent Image started small, but after 
        producing a high-budget Calgon commercial spoofing Fantastic Voyage (1966),
        Romero felt that The Latent Image had the experience and equipment to produce
        a feature film.[38] They wanted to capitalize on the film industry's "thirst
        for the bizarre", according to Romero.[41] He, Streiner, and John A. Russo 
        contacted Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman, president, and vice president 
        respectively, of a Pittsburgh-based industrial film firm called Hardman 
        Associates, Inc. The Latent Image pitched their idea for a then-untitled
        horror film.</p>

        <p>These discussions led to the creation of Image Ten, a production company
         chartered to produce a single feature film. The initial budget was $6,000;
         each member of the production company invested $600 for a share of the profits.
         Ten more investors contributed another $6,000, but this was still insufficient.
         Production stopped multiple times during filming while Romero used early footage
         to persuade additional investors. Image Ten eventually raised approximately 
         $114,000 for the budget ($999,000 today).</p>

           farmhouse.</p>

The script was co-written by Russo and Romero. They abandoned an early horror comedy
concept about adolescent aliens, after realizing they would not have the budget
to create a convincing spaceship. Russo proposed a more constrained narrative where a
young man runs away from home and discovers aliens harvesting human corpses for food 
in a cemetery. Romero combined this idea with an unpublished short story about 
flesh-eating ghouls, and they began filming with an incomplete script. According to 
Russo, the screenplay written prior to filming only covered events up to the emergence
of the Cooper family. Russo completed the script while filming and Romero later expanded
the final pages of his short story into the sequels Dawn of the Dead (1978) and 
Day of the Dead (1985).</p>

<p>Romero drew inspiration from Richard Matheson's I Am Legend (1954), a horror novel
   about a plague that ravages a futuristic Los Angeles. The infected in I Am Legend
   become vampire-like creatures and prey on the uninfected. Matheson described 
   Romero's interpretation as "kind of cornball", and more theft than homage. In an
   interview, Romero contrasted Night of the Living Dead with I Am Legend. He explained
   that Matheson wrote about the aftermath of a complete global upheaval; Romero wanted
   to explore how people would respond to that kind of disaster as it developed.</p>

<p>Much of the dialogue was altered, rewritten, or improvised by the cast. Lead 
   actress Judith O'Dea told an interviewer, "I don't know if there was an actual working
   script! We would go over what basically had to be done, then just did it the way we each 
   felt it should be done".[18] One example offered by O'Dea concerns a scene where Barbra 
   tells Ben about Johnny's death. O'Dea said that the script vaguely had Barbra talk about 
   riding in the car with Johnny before they were attacked. She described Barbra's dialogue 
   for the scene as entirely improv. Eastman modified the scenes written for Helen and 
   Harry Cooper in the cellar. Karl Hardman attributed Ben's lines to lead actor Duane Jones. 
   Ben was an uneducated truck driver in the script until Jones began to rewrite his character.</p>

<p>The lead role was initially written for a white actor, but upon casting black actor 
   Duane Jones, Romero intentionally did not alter the script to reflect this. The film 
   appeared in theaters at a time when very few black actors played leading roles. The rare 
   exceptions, like the consciously black heroes played by Sidney Poitier, were written as 
   subservient to make those characters palatable to white audiences. Asked in 2013 if he took 
   inspiration from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in the same year that the movie 
   was made, Romero responded in the negative, noting that he only heard about the shooting when 
   he was on his way to find distribution for the finished film.</p>

The small budget dictated much of the production process.[42][66] Scenes were filmed near 
Evans City, Pennsylvania, 30 miles (48 km) north of Pittsburgh in rural Butler County; the opening 
sequence was shot at the Evans City Cemetery on Franklin Road, south of the borough. Lacking the 
money to build or purchase a house for the main set, the filmmakers rented a nearby farmhouse 
scheduled for demolition. Though it lacked running water, some crew members slept there during the 
shooting, taking baths in a nearby creek. The building's neglected cellar was not a viable location 
for filming, so the few basement scenes were shot beneath The Latent Image offices. The basement 
door shown in the film was cut into a wall by the production team and led nowhere.</p>

<p>Props and special effects were simple and limited by the budget. The blood, for example, was 
   Bosco Chocolate Syrup drizzled over cast members' bodies. The human flesh consumed by ghouls 
   consisted of meat and offal donated by an investor's butcher shop. Zombie makeup varied 
   during the film. Initially, makeup was limited to white skin with blackened eyes. As 
   filming progressed, mortician's wax simulated wounds and decaying flesh. Filming took place 
   between July 1967 and January 1968 under various titles. Work began under the generic working 
   title Monster Flick, was changed to Night of Anubis after Romero's short story that provided 
   the basis for the script, and was completed as Night of the Flesh Eaters, a title not used in 
   the final release due to a potential conflict with a similarly named film. The small budget 
   led Romero to shoot on 35 mm black-and-white film. The completed film ultimately benefited 
   from the decision, as film historian Joseph Maddrey describes the black-and-white filming as 
   "guerrilla-style", resembling "the unflinching authority of a wartime newsreel". He found 
   the exploitation film to resemble a documentary on social instability.</p>

   Night of the Living Dead was the first feature-length film directed by George A. Romero. His 
   initial work involved filming advertisements, industrial films, and shorts for Pittsburgh public 
   broadcaster WQED's children's series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Romero's decision to direct 
   Night of the Living Dead launched his career as a horror director. He took the helm of the sequels as 
   well as Season of the Witch (1972), The Crazies (1973), Martin (1978), Creepshow (1982) and The Dark Half (1993). 
   Critics saw the influence of the horror and science-fiction films of the 1950s in Romero's directorial style. 
   Stephen Paul Miller, for instance, witnessed "a revival of fifties schlock shock ... and the army general's 
   television discussion of military operations in the film echoes the often inevitable calling-in of the army 
   in fifties horror films". Miller admits that "Night of the Living Dead takes greater relish in mocking these 
   military operations through the general's pompous demeanor" and the government's inability to source the 
   zombie epidemic or protect the citizenry.[87] Romero described the film's intended mood as a downward arc 
   from near hopelessness to complete tragedy. Film historian Carl Royer praised the film's sophistication—especially 
   considering Romero's limited experience—and noted the use of chiaroscuro (film noir style) lighting to create 
   a mood of increasing alienation.</p>

<p>While some critics dismissed Romero's film because of the graphic scenes, writer R. H. W. Dillard claimed 
   that the "open-eyed detailing" of taboo heightened the film's success. He asked, "What girl has not, at one time 
   or another, wished to kill her mother? And Karen, in the film, offers a particularly vivid opportunity to commit 
   the forbidden deed vicariously."[89] Romero featured social taboos as key themes, especially cannibalism. Film 
   historian Robin Wood interprets the flesh-eating scenes of Night of the Living Dead as a late-1960s critique of 
   American capitalism. Wood argues that the zombies' consumption of people represents the logical endpoint of human 
   interactions under capitalism.</p>

                    <p>Post-production</p>
<p>Members of Image Ten were involved in filming and post-production, participating in loading camera magazines, 
   gaffing, constructing props, recording sounds and editing. Production stills were shot and printed by 
   Karl Hardman, assisted by a "production line" of other cast members. Upon completion of post-production, Image Ten 
   found it difficult to secure a distributor willing to show the film with the gruesome scenes intact. Columbia rejected 
   the film for its lack of color, and American International Pictures declined after requests to soften it and re-shoot 
   the final scene were rejected by producers. The Walter Reade Organization agreed to show the film uncensored but 
   changed the title from Night of the Flesh Eaters to Night of the Living Dead because of an existing film with a similar 
   title. While changing the title, the copyright notice was accidentally deleted from the early releases of the film.</p>
